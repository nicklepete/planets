So Pluto is the smallest one.
I'm not even sure if it is a planet anymore.
They kicked it out from planets a few years ago.
But maybe it's actually back!

How do we define what a planet really is? 
And if pluto isn't a planet, what is it?

How do school kids cope with this ambiguity???

Well, if I remember it correctly.
It has to have a gravity strong enough and a size big enough.
Yes, I just googled it.
Probably different agencies have different opinion on this matter.
It's just NASA's point of view.
